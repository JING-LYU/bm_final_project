## Abstract

In this project, we aim to build regression models based on a set of demographic variables to estimate county-level crime rates. After an exploratory analysis of the variables on their distributions and correlations, we derived more meaningful variables by manipulating the existing ones, removed outlier values, and implement several variable selection methods. Using the selected variables, we trained a linear regression model, elaborate on the model by adding several interactive terms, and did cross-validations. All 3 resulting models have achieved a good estimation of the training set. The first model has the best prediction on new data (in the testing set), whereas the other two models, despite a better performance of the training data, may have the problem of overfitting.

## Introduction

Over the last three decades, crime has become a major public concern in the US arousing massive political discussion and public expenditure[1]. Crime rates in major cities experienced a general rise from the 1960s to 1990s, with two peaks observed in 1980 and in early 1990s[2]. Despite extensive attention across the nation, factors influencing crime trends were not yet made clear[1]. In this project, we examined crime rates and potential affecting factors in 440 US counties from "County Demographic Information" (CDI) data set, and construct a multiple linear regression model to predict the crime rates.


### Dataset

We analyzed data from the “County Demographic Information” (CDI) data set, which contains characteristics of 440 counties in the United States collected from 1990-1992. The primary goal of this investigation is to develop insight relevant to predicting the crime rate in counties.
