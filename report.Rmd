## Introduction

Over the last three decades, crime has become a major public concern in the US arousing massive political discussion and public expenditure[1]. Crime rates in major cities experienced a general rise from the 1960s to 1990s, with two peaks observed in 1980 and in early 1990s[2]. Despite extensive attention across the nation, factors influencing crime trends were not yet made clear[1]. In this project, we examined crime rates and potential affecting factors in 440 US counties from "County Demographic Information" (CDI) data set, and construct a multiple linear regression model to predict the crime rates.


### Dataset

We analyzed data from the “County Demographic Information” (CDI) data set, which contains characteristics of 440 counties in the United States collected from 1990-1992. The primary goal of this investigation is to develop insight relevant to predicting the crime rate in counties.
